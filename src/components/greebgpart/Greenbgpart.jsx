                    trust as a virtue has consistently played an essential role in every great human achievement. and consistently, its importance has been overlooked. not just by individuals, but by entire societies. we felt it was time someone gave it the spotlight it deserves. especially for the ones who live by this virtue: the trustworthy.
                    so we thought of creating a system that rewards its members for doing good and being trustworthy. this way, trust as a virtue becomes something to aspire to, just the way it should be. then we went one step ahead: we built it. we know we are on the right track because here you are.
                    if you make it to CRED, congratulations and welcome. we have a lot of things planned for you.
